# Advent Of Code

My Python solutions for the problems proposed at https://adventofcode.com, that I started on 2021.

I try to have soloutions running in less than 2s for each problem.

There may be some problems for which I don't provide a file, it may be because I solved it "by hand" or... I lost it (:
